This is the fork of Google's april joke Morse Keyboard.

Introduction
------------
This Google's april joke was very fun. But I think that a truth is often told in a joke.
I would like to tell you about why I decided to fork this keyboard, and will I use it.
At first, I like typing. And I like typing on a real keyboard. Ten-finger typing gives me possibility to write down some text not thinking about what keys should I tap to type some word. With real PC keyboard I can type something like 200-300 symbols per minute for now (in russian and in english too).
Smartphone keyboards are always pain for me. Trying to tap at some tiny virtual button is too hard for me. And I can't type no looking at keyboard.
Swipe keyboards are bad too: this is very hard to my fingers to draw some difficult paths. After hour or two per day of such typing my fingers are hurt.
The best approach I can remember is T9 keyboard on old phones. But the main issue of this: you should learn keyboard with your dictionary. And this process can be very very long. Without this learning T9 has less advantages with virtual QWERTY-keyboard.

So what?
--------
So I think that idea of Morse keyboard is not very bad.
With this keyboard you can:
 - type not looking at the keyboard
 - type anything you want, you don't need a dictionary (of course, dictionary and predictions can be enabled to gain typing speed)
 - learn Morse code, so maybe this can save you some day (but I hope nothing bad will happen :) ).

But this approach has one huge disadvantage: you should tap on buttons more times.
How hurt this was for fingers? Will this be simpler or not? No one can say without trying.

Why fork?
----------
So, why didn't I use the original keyboard?
There are some limitations of the original keyboard. And with these limitations no one can use this instead of any other keyboard.
I wrote a list of limitations for me:
 - I need Russian language support
 - I need punctuation
 - Shift logic (original app provides any symbol with Caps, so everyone thought that I'm screaming :/ )

Before doing this I decided to adapt original project to Android Studio.

**The project is in progress**
